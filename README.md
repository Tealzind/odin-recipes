odin recipes project

This repository hosts a project website built to display three cooking recipes.
The repo has an index.html file used as the home page, a directory that hosts the images used to display the final dishes, and a directory that
has three html files each named after their respective dishes.

If you open index.html, you will see a homepage that has an unordered list of three links to the three recipes. Upon clicking a link, you will be directed to the respective recipe html file which provides an image of the dish, an unordered list of the ingredients needed to make the dish, and an ordered list of the steps intended for cooking the dish.

At the bottom of each recipe page is a link that says "Click here..." and will return you to the main page for access to the other recipes.
